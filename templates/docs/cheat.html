            <h1>How to plagiarize research papers</h1>
            <p>
                Writing a paper is hard, and you just had a great idea.
                <br />
                <br />
                Instead of working on your research, why not just copy and paste
                content from other papers? We can complete the paper very
                quickly, and get away with the credits because no one will
                notice.
                <br />
                <br />
                Unfortunately, a lot of people have the same idea everyday, and
                it is robbing others of their hard-earned innovative idea and
                research work.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please do not plagiarize other papers. You get nothing out of
                it, and make innovation and research a worse experience for
                everyone, yourself included.
                <b> Doing so will only invite legal action against you. </b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Instead, why not do all the hard work? It will take longer but
                be much more rewarding.
