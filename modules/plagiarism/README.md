# IMPORTANT!
This is where all the detection stuff should go. Nowhere else. 
If this module is used standalone, the detection should still work.

This module should be in `modules` directory, not in any of its subdirectories. Otherwise, it won't work because many imports used in the source code use `modules.plagiarism`.
