# Contributing

## I want to contribute code to Lipyplagiarism

- [Set up your development environment](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/).
- Code formatting uses [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for the rest of this application.
- All modules related to detecting plagiarized text should go to `/modules/plagiarism/`. Nowhere else. Nothing related to the website UI should go there. You can add those elsewhere.

## I want to report a bug or a problem about Lipyplagiarism

[**Make an issue**](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/lipyplagiarism/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). 
However, note that issues that provide little value compared to the required effort may be closed. Before creating an issue, make sure that:

1. You list the steps to reproduce the problem to show that other users may experience it as well, if the issue is not self-descriptive.
2. Search to make sure it isn't a duplicate. [The advanced search syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) may come in handy.
3. It is not a trivial problem or demand unrealistic dev time to fix.

## I want to suggest a feature for Lipyplagiarism

Issue tickets on features that lack potential or effectiveness are not useful and may be closed. 
**When you're ready, [make an issue ticket](https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/lipyplagiarism/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)** 
and link relevant, constructive comments regarding it in your issue ticket (such as a detailed Reddit post; linking to an empty forum thread with only your own commentary adds no value). Make sure that the feature you propose:

1. Is **effective in delivering a goal**. A feature that adds nothing new is purely fancy; please develop a userscript or userstyle for your personal use instead.
2. Doesn't rely on mundane assumptions. Non-technical people have the tendency to measure how difficult / easy a feature is to implement based on their unreliable instincts, and such assumptions wastes everyone's time. **Point out what needs to happen**, not what you think will happen.
3. Is **unique, if you're aiming to solve a problem**. Features that can easily be replaced by easier ideas have little value and may not have to be brought up to begin with.
4. Is **clear and concise**. If ambiguities exist, define them or propose options.
